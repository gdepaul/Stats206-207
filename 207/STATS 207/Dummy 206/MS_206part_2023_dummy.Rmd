**Instruction**:  <br>
In this question, you will be aked to perform some tasks in R.  Please submit the codes and plots along with your answers. You should submit an .html file. 


**Question**: <br>
In *dummy.Rdata* you will find a data set called *data* with two variables, *V1, V2*. Please first load the data into the R workspace. **Please then**: <br>
 i. Obtain mean and variance for each variable. <br>
 ii. Draw a histgram for each variable and briefly comment on its distribution. <br> 
 
 
 i.) 
```{r}
load("dummy.RData")
V1 <- data$V1
V2 <- data$V2

print(mean(V1))
print(var(V1))

print(mean(V2))
print(var(V2))
```

ii.) 
```{r}
hist(V1)
```

We see that V1 might have a bimodal distribution. 

```{r}
hist(V2)
```

It's hard to tell exactly the distribution. This may be a constant distribution. Or a truncated normal curve with
specified boundaries.
